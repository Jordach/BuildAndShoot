PLEASE BE DISSAPOINTED. This hasn't even gone somewhere yet.\r\n\r\nExplanatory Stuff Below!\r\n=============\r\n\r\nBuildAndShoot Client\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe client is where the game \"actually\" is.\r\n\r\nThe client renders all the stuff what happens during each PySnip / Server step. (Note: PySnip bundled with released game versions.)\r\n\r\nBuildAndShoot Server\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe server is where the logic comes into play.\r\n\r\nTHe server side is where all the bullets fly, grenades go boom etc, all as binary code executions.\r\n\r\nBuilding then Shooting\r\n=============\r\n\r\nLibaries:\r\n\r\nfreeglut-2.8.0\r\n\r\nglm-0.9.4.1\r\n\r\nglew-1.9.0\r\n\r\nIf you git cloned like a good person should, then it should be pretty obvious that you should:\r\n\r\n$-: cd BuildAndShoot\r\n\r\n$-: cd src\r\n\r\n$-: make\r\n\r\n$-: ./BnSClient\r\n\r\nCompiling info should go here!\r\n\r\nCoding Ettiquete\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAny bullshit such as tabs in a function line eg:\r\n\r\nint asdf (bracket)this, this,\r\nthis, and this(closing bracket)\r\nis difficult for HUMANS to read.\r\n\r\nThis is easy to read.\r\n\r\nint Network(bullet, ammocount, magic, particles)\r\n\r\nSubmitting Fixes / Bugs\r\n=============\r\n\r\nSubmit things such as bug reports, missing items, models media, etc.\r\n\r\nFeel free to pull request things when a branch is done.\r\n\r\nProTip: Squash commits when done, it makes the history easier to clean when I'm either reverting broken changes, or fixing crap code.\r\n\r\nMisc.\r\n=============\r\n\r\nI DO NOT OWN THE NAME BuildAndShoot, I am using it to notify users that the client is built for and designed for the older Voxlap AoS players.\r\n\r\nThis is what I hopefully think the end should look like:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QINwCaJgX4o\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
