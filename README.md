BuildAndShoot
=============

BuildAndShoot; a Open Source Voxel shooter licensed under the LGPL.

BuildAndShoot Client
=============

The client is where the game "actually" is.

The client renders all the stuff what happens during each PySnip / Server step. (Note: PySnip bundled with released game versions.)

BuildAndShoot Server
=============

The server is where the logic comes into play.

THe server side is where all the bullets fly, grenades go boom etc, all as binary code executions.

Building then Shooting
=============

N/A

Misc.
=============

This is what I hopefully think the end should look like:
