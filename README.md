BuildAndShoot Client
=============

BuildAndShoot Client; a Open Source Voxel shooter licensed under the LGPL.

IF YOU ARE READING THIS AND EXPECTING A BUILD / CLIENT. PLEASE BE DISSAPOINTED. This hasn't even gone somewhere yet.

Explanatory Stuff Below!
=============

BuildAndShoot Client
=============

The client is where the game "actually" is.

The client renders all the stuff what happens during each PySnip / Server step. (Note: PySnip bundled with released game versions.)

BuildAndShoot Server
=============

The server is where the logic comes into play.

THe server side is where all the bullets fly, grenades go boom etc, all as binary code executions.

Building then Shooting
=============

I am using this engine:

http://gameplay3d.org

SO PLEASE, GO READ THE WIKI ON IT!

ALSO: KV6 / VXL model support is coming soon!

Coding Ettiquete
=============

Any bullshit such as tabs in a function line eg:

int asdf (bracket)this, this,
this, and this(closing bracket)
is difficult for HUMANS to read.

This is easy to read.

int Network(bullet, ammocount, magic, particles)

Submitting Fixes / Bugs
=============

Submit things such as bug reports, missing items, models media, etc.

Feel free to pull request things when a branch is done.

ProTip: Squash commits when done, it makes the history easier to clean when I'm either reverting broken changes, or fixing crap code.

Misc.
=============

I DO NOT OWN THE NAME BuildAndShoot, I am using it to notify users that the client is built for and designed for the older Voxlap AoS players.

This is what the game should look like with full 0.75 network compatibility:

This is what I hopefully think the end should look like:
