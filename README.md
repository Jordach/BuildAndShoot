BuildAndShoot
=============

BuildAndShoot; a Open Source Voxel shooter licensed under the LGPL.

BuildAndShoot Client
=============

The client is where the game "actually" is.

The client renders all the stuff what happens during each PySnip / Server step. (Note: PySnip bundled with released game versions.)

BuildAndShoot Server
=============

The server is where the logic comes into play.

THe server side is where all the bullets fly, grenades go boom etc, all as binary code executions.

Building then Shooting
=============

Compiling info should go here!

Coding Ettiquete
=============

Any bullshit such as tabs in a function line eg:

int asdf (bracket)this, this,
this, and this(closing bracket)
is difficult for HUMANS to read.

This is easy to read.

int Network(bullet, ammocount, magic, particales)

Submitting Fixes / Bugs
=============

Submit things such as bug reports, missing items, models media, etc.

Feel free to pull request things when a branch is done.

ProTip: Squash commits when done, it makes the history easier to clean when I'm either reverting broken changes, or fixing crap code.

Misc.
=============

I DO NOT OWN THE NAME BuildAndShoot, I am using it to notify users that the client is built for and designed for the older Voxlap AoS players.

This is what I hopefully think the end should look like:
